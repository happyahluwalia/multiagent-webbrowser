# multiagent-webbrowser
Idea is to build a multi-agent web browser: an agentic system with several agents collaborating to solve problems using the web!

                     |      | Web Search agent |      |
                     |      +------------------+      |
                     |         |            |         |
                     |  Web Search tool     |         |
                     |             Visit webpage tool |
                     +--------------------------------+

Create a web search tool

For web browsing, we can already use our pre-existing DuckDuckGoSearchTool tool to provide a Google search equivalent.

But then we will also need to be able to peak into the page found by the DuckDuckGoSearchTool. To do so, we could import the library's built-in VisitWebpageTool, but we will build it again to see how it's done.

So let's create our VisitWebpageTool tool from scratch using markdownify.

Now that we have all the tools search and visit_webpage, we can use them to create the web agent.

Which configuration to choose for this agent?

    Web browsing is a single-timeline task that does not require parallel tool calls, so JSON tool calling works well for that. We thus choose a ReactJsonAgent.
    Also, since sometimes web search requires exploring many pages before finding the correct answer, we prefer to increase the number of max_iterations to 10.
